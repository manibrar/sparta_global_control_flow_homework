# Javascript function using test driven development

## Timings

60 - 90 Minutes

## Summary

Using what we have learned about functions, arguments and returns, work your way through the functions listed as comments in the app.js file. Each function must be written out exactly according to it's corresponding comment.

The spec folder contains a testing script that will show you what each function needs to do and whether you have written it correctly. You can run these tests like this by loading the index.html in your browser.

The first time you run this command you will notice all the tests report RED. Your task is to write the functions required that will pass the tests.

**HINTS**

 - Every function must return something for the test to pass - always remember the return keyword
 - You will get Jasmine errors saying the functions don't do what they're supposed to, as well as console errors if there are syntax problems. Keep the console open in the browser to read these.
